Azure Load Balancer

Description
Azure Load Balancer is a layer 4 (TCP, UDP) load balancer that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple VM instances. It helps improve availability and scalability of your applications by spreading the load across resources.

Features
- Load Balancing: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple VM instances for optimal resource utilization.
- High Availability**: Enhances the availability of your applications by ensuring seamless failover.
- Health Probes**: Monitors the health of backend instances and directs traffic only to healthy instances.
- Inbound NAT Rules**: Allows inbound network traffic to be forwarded to specific VM instances.

Installation
To create an Azure Load Balancer:
1. Log in to the Azure portal.
2. Navigate to the Networking section and select Load Balancers.
3. Click on "+ Add" to create a new Load Balancer.
4. Configure the necessary settings such as frontend IP configuration, backend pool, health probes, and load balancing rules.
5. Review and create the Load Balancer.

Usage
Once the Azure Load Balancer is set up, you can:
- Monitor traffic distribution and health of backend instances.
- Update load balancing rules as needed to optimize resource utilization.
- Scale your application by adding or removing backend instances dynamically.
